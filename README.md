The most recent version of this project is Project7 folder as of Nov. 23rd.

This is the Personal Fitness Application project that I have been working on for all of Fall25 Semester
This is an application that records your name, age, gender, height, and the day's weight. Given this information, it will calculate your BMI. The user can log the exercise they did for the day and the duration of the workout.

Features include:
-  Creating a user profile
-  Logging daily exercises
-  Veiwing most recent exercises, and your exercise history
-  Unlimitled hsitory!!!

Changelog:
- Update (9/17) : Added verification for most of the inputs giving an error message. Updated some of the print statements to look nicer
- Update (9/22) : Made methods to simplify code. Added switch case in a do while for users to choose whatthey would like to do. Added spacing to printed text to make it look nicer.
- Update (9/25) : Made getNum() generic so that it can work with any number.
- Upadate (10/3) : Made functions for several aspects of the program. Made all the verification its own function. Fitness data now can have history.

- Upadate (10/29) : Changed the method of storing data to creating a structure or "object" for each entry of fittness data. Changed from multiple arrays into one vector using the new structure as the type. Modified all other methods to reflect this change of array to vector.
- Update (10/30) : Added a nested structure, with a user structure to hold basic info and the vector that holds their fitness records. Simplified the fuctions using the modifiers and acessors that the vector class has. Added new function to simplify the code for calulating BMI. Users can now see if they have a decrease or increase in their BMI.
